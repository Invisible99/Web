Before this fucking thing works in WAMP

1) Create .htacess file in parallel to application holder and just copy past the following code:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /CodeIgniter/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^system.*
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.php/$1 [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L]
2) Change $config['index_page'] to blank in config.php in application folder as below:

$config['index_page'] = '';
3) Enable "rewrite_module" of apache.

Now you can access your site without index.php in url.
